# Overwatch:
## Each Hero Lives Once Workshop Mod
Made a 6v6 custom game mode using the Overwatch Workshop<br>
Rules:<br>
Both teams start with a score equal to the current number of heroes in the game<br>
Players cannot pick the same hero as a teammate<br>
When a player dies their team's score is reduced by one and their hero becomes unavailable for their team so they have to select a different hero and then respawn<br>
When a player dies and their team's score is less than the players in their team they enter spectate instead of respawning<br>
The team who reaches a score of 0(meaning they run out of heroes) first loses the game<br>
Workshop Code: GQSRQF<br>
